## About

This repository contains a single file `ReportTime.robot` which contains examples of concepts needed to do many web application verification steps in RobotFramework.

The purpose of RobotFramework is to speed up verification that important functionality remains intact when upgrading web applications and web application servers.

Using RobotFramework can increase the assurance, availability, reliability and patch frequency of web application systems by increasing confidence in the reliability and testability of software releases, allowing a faster and more trusted software update cycle.

The purpose of this example script is to help familiarize maintainers of web application servers with the capabilities available through the free and open source tool, RobotFramework. 

This project has migrated to CodeBerg.org. See https://codeberg.org/EdTheDev/Learn_RobotFramework_IllinoisPTR for latest updates.
